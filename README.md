## How to use it

1. Add acrylic.min.css to your website by either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acrylic-css) or [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/acrylic.css/) or using the [css file](https://github.com/kolappannathan/acrylic-css/tree/master/dist).
2. Change the image URL in background-image:url("../demo/demo.jpg"); to the point to your website background.
3. Now the effects should work

### Warning

This styling works well with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. However there are some difference on the rendering in Microsoft Edge. This is due to the absense of support of some css properties like ackground-blend-mode.
