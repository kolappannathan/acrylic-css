# acrylic-css
A css based style for using acrylic effect in websites. This is inpired from Microsoft's Fluent Design Language.

### Warning

This styling works well with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. However there are some difference on the rendering in Microsoft Edge. This is due to the absense of support of some css properties like ackground-blend-mode.
